This is my personal Discord bot, which will have many different commands involving the RiotAPI later so you can pull certain data about summoners.

Current Commands:

>pls - Test to see if the bot can send commands.
>name - Repeats the name of the user that sends the message.
>reversename - Repeats the name of the user that sends the message, but backwards.
>vulnerable - The bot is tired of being called a vulnerable little girl. (Thanks Dave)
>die - Allows the owner of the bot (as set within the code) to shut the bot down.

Heavily WIP, don't expect much for some time.
